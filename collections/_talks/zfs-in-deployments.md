## Descripci√≥n

My first talk for the [Madrid DevOps](https://madrid.devops.es/) community.  It was about the ZFS filesystem
 and the benefits to use it in production environment and other scenarios.

The talk was shared with the help of Miguel Angel Tarazaga (@miguitas) who talked
 about an alternative file system called BTRFS, very similar to ZFS.
