## Description

Jos√© Juan Mora (@jjmoraunix) and I met years ago in an OpenSolaris talk, and 
I was impressed by his patience and passion about technology and his skills as
 speaker.  This time I had the chance to talk with him about his book "DevOps y
 el camino de baldosas amarillas", so I invited him to talk openly in a meetup
 and he accepted (he also accepted some beers as well) and I redacted a talk with questions I wanted to ask him about his book.  He gave me permission to 
 use his funny drawings used in the book to make it more funny and the talk was
 a great time for us.
