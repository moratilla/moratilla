I was trying to create a videogame with my kids but they are too anxious and impatients to let me teach them all the parts of videogame design.  So I ended picking up some ideas and work on them quite fast to produce something they can use and have fun.

I have little experience with [scratch, from MIT](https://scratch.mit.edu), but enough knowledge to understand how it works.  What I learnt was it was possible to add a module with blocks to use the camera as a sensor and some other cool features.

So, I played with it a little and then show them a prototype for a game where speed and reflex are the key to win.  Just use your hands (or body) to catch the characters from Daniel's Tiger Neigborghood (from Fred Roger).

Enjoy the game
