## Description

I found several years ago this JavaScript game framework called [PhaserJS](https://phaser.io) and I started
 to use it for my own games.  These are some examples I have been working on recently.

### Games

Here I have created a web site with the games I'm creating using Phaser.  Everything here is experimental,
 some games can fail or not load while I'm working on them.
