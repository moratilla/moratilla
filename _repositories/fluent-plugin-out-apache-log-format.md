## Description

While parsing logs from a rails website, I had to perform a plugin that converted a custom log format to an standard Apache common combined log format, that was read by the [SEO Log File Analyser](https://www.screamingfrog.co.uk/log-file-analyser/).

This module helped me to understand how fluent works internally.
