## Description

[ASDF-VM](https://asdf-vm.com/) is a tool to manage multiple runtime versions of commands, programing languages, etc., with a single CLI tool.

I authored the following plugins:

* asdf-cheat-plugin: [cheat](https://github.com/cheat/cheat) is a command line tool that provides oneliners and cheatsheets published by the community in github.
* asdf-k2tf: [k2tf](https://github.com/sl1pm4t/k2tf) is a tool to translate Kubernetes YAMLS into Hashicorp Terraform HCL code.  I found it very useful and decided to make a plugin for it.
* asdf-cloud-nuke: [cloud-nuke](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke) Gruntwork has lots of tools like terragrunt, and this is a little tool to nuke and clear an AWS account with a single command.
