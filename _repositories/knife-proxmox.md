## Description

Time ago (2014) I was working in a solution to provide continuous integration and delivery of our product using [proxmox virtual environment](https://www.proxmox.com/en/proxmox-ve).  I found the API was very useful and had high potential to make scripts and programs that created instances of containers that could be then be configured using [chef](https://chef.io), that was the configuration management solution at my company that time.

This plugin was released in [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org/search?query=knife-proxmox) and I was very happy for the good feedback, but I moved to another company and I didn't have enough time to keep maintaining it.

Now, it's deprecated.
