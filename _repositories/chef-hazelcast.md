## Description

I always being in love with [hazelcast](https://hazelccast.com) since the times I was working with grid computing.
  My old good times learning [Sun Grid Engine](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sun_Grid_Engine), [HTCondor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTCondor), [JPPF](https://www.jppf.org/) and participating in [boinc](https://boinc.berkeley.edu/) projects.

So I had an opportunity to automate the configuration of a hazelcast database with a chef cookbook and I did it.

The code is pretty clean and easy to understand.
