#### Facts

Spanish, +40 years old and counting.  Husband, father of 2 kids, and nerd that
 spends all his free time tinkering with computers.  My curiosity is vastly
 larger than my available time, but I like to research and try new things.

#### Interests

My first computer was an Amstrad CPC6128, an old 8-bit computer from the 80's
 on which I developed my firsts programs, and loved the fantastical worlds it
 opened to me.  By the way, I still keep it functional.

Since then I loved computers and virtual worlds.  Worked in Metaverse concept
 since 2005 (in Second Life, Entropia Project and others).  Now I use Unreal,
 Unity and Roblox to make virtual reality scenes (for personal use).

Gamer with no time, I'm mentoring my kids into a great gaming experience, not
 only as an entertainment, but a incredible way to become skillful and have an
 open mind.  Not only using computers, but board games like chess, cards, and
 RPG's.

#### Work Experience

Now more than 20 years of working experience, let me to go to the beginning.
  I just began to work for a small ISDN and RTC Internet provider, developing 
 and deploying systems and services for end users and customers.

Then I worked for Sun Microsystems as certified instructor and field engineer,
 mainly focused on Internet Services and middleware software.  My favorite
 service was the Directory Server (LDAP service) used to provide identities
 to several millions of users.  I have been working in Identity products for
 a while and implemented it in several customers around Spain and Portugal.

As instructor I was involved in systems, identity and web technologies mostly
 all the time.  But also taught databases (MySQL) and rare and weird custom
 courses (like NIS+ for a ship, or how to Linux on a S390 system).

I liked grid technologies but unfortunately I couldn't get a chance to work
 professionally on it, but I did several personal side projects using Sun Grid
 Engine, JPPF, and Condor.

In 2011 I moved out from Sun - Oracle world to learn more from startups and
 get a new life as system administrator and agile coach for systems.

I have been working as system administrator, cloud engineer and DevOps
 evangelist since then for companies like Taric, BQ, and Kelisto.  I promoted
 DevOps culture and practices, and the Three Ways as stated in the "The Phoenix
 project" by Gene Kim, Kevin Behr and George Spafford as the way to continuous
 improvement.

I have been in charge of technical projects working in small teams as the PM as
 well as the systems architect because of my experience, but I would like to
 work more in the development side, helping and providing support to others.

Not only that, I have been working with Business Product Owners, providing them
 with tools to get fresh data and reports to get the pulse on the business.  

As I left the professional teaching, I have been doing some small training
 sessions sometimes, teaching about DevOps and cloud providers.  I enjoy
 training, and it's something that definitively I would like to keep doing.

#### Affiliations

Madrid DevOps coordinator (not currently).  My main work here has been to power
 the community by providing a new way to manage the community and I have been an
 active speaker, working to provide more relevancy to the transforming culture
 than just the technologies used to automate.

Not very active right now in communities, I used to attend XP and Agile conferences, 
 trying to learn how to be a better facilitator and enforce the DevOps culture at
 my job.
