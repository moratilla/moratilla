#### Fun Facts & Quirks

I'm a Spaniard, husband, father of two, and a self-proclaimed nerd (48+ and
 counting!). My free time almost invariably involves tinkering with computers, 
 driven by a curiosity that always seems larger than the clock allows. This 
 means I'm constantly exploring new tech, even if just scratching the surface. 
 This blog is where I share some of those explorations.

#### Let's Connect (Professionally!)

I tend to stay off most social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and
 Instagram. My exception is LinkedIn, which I use specifically for maintaining 
 professional contacts.

#### My Tech Story: From 8-bit Wonders to Virtual Realms

My journey into technology began in the 1980s with an Amstrad CPC6128.
 This early 8-bit computer wasn't just where I developed my first programs; 
 it sparked a lifelong fascination with the potential of computing and virtual 
 worlds â€“ remarkably, I still maintain the machine in working order.

This foundational interest naturally led me to explore virtual environments
 more deeply. Since 2005, I've actively engaged with early metaverse concepts 
 on platforms like Second Life and Entropia Project. My exploration continues 
 today through personal projects, utilizing modern engines like Unreal, Unity, 
 and Roblox to create virtual reality experiences.

This interest extends to interactive systems in general. I view gaming,
 encompassing digital platforms as well as strategic board games, card games, 
 and RPGs, as a valuable medium for developing analytical skills and 
 fostering creativity â€“ a perspective I actively share through mentoring my 
 children.

#### My Professional Adventures: Building, Teaching, and Leading

A seasoned IT professional with over two decades of experience, I embarked
 on my career by developing and deploying internet systems and services for 
 a burgeoning ISDN and RTC provider. This foundational role provided a strong 
 understanding of end-user needs and infrastructure deployment.

My tenure at Sun Microsystems marked a significant period of growth. As a
 Certified Instructor and Field Engineer, I specialized in internet services 
 and middleware solutions. I cultivated deep expertise in Identity Management, 
 particularly with the Directory Server (LDAP), where I was instrumental in 
 architecting and implementing identity solutions for millions of users across 
 Spain and Portugal. My responsibilities extended to delivering comprehensive 
 training on systems, identity management, and web technologies. Notably, I 
 also broadened my instructional portfolio to include databases (MySQL) and 
 specialized, bespoke courses such as NIS+ and Linux on S390 systems, 
 demonstrating adaptability and a commitment to knowledge transfer. 
 My enthusiasm for grid technologies led to independent exploration through 
 personal projects utilizing Sun Grid Engine, JPPF, and Condor.

In 2011, seeking new challenges and a dynamic startup environment, I
 transitioned to roles as a System Administrator and Agile Coach for systems. 
 Since then, I have served as a System Administrator, Cloud Engineer, and 
 DevOps advocate for companies including Taric, BQ, Kelisto, Oneclick, and 
 Transparent Intelligence. In these roles, I championed DevOps culture and the 
 principles outlined in "The Phoenix Project" to drive continuous improvement 
 and operational efficiency. My experience has naturally led to taking ownership 
 of technical projects, often functioning as both Project Manager and Systems 
 Architect within small teams. I am now keen to leverage my extensive background 
 to contribute more directly to development teams, offering guidance and support.

Beyond technical implementation, I have collaborated closely with Business
 Product Owners, empowering them with data-driven insights through the development 
 of relevant tools and reports. While my formal teaching role has evolved, I 
 continue to conduct training sessions on DevOps and cloud platforms, reflecting 
 my passion for education and knowledge sharing.

#### My Community Contributions: Connecting and Inspiring

As a former Madrid DevOps Coordinator, I played a pivotal role in revitalizing 
 the local community. My focus extended beyond technological automation, 
 emphasizing the cultural transformation inherent in DevOps adoption. I actively 
 contributed as a speaker, aiming to provide relevant insights and guidance to 
 the evolving landscape.

While my current community engagement is less frequent, I previously maintained
 an active presence at XP and Agile conferences. These experiences were 
 invaluable in honing my facilitation skills and deepening my understanding of 
 how to effectively cultivate a DevOps culture within organizational settings.

I also hold a strong appreciation for the Open Source ethos, regularly 
attending events such as FOSDEM to stay abreast of the latest developments and 
advancements in the field.
