2024 has been a tough year to me.  I had to assume that I'm not capable of some things anymore and I must admit I have an age.

I used to write notes on keep.google.com, but I feel they were not in my mind, that all those notes there were like the typical set of post-it notes you write once and never read again until you are cleaning your desk.  So, why I was writting those notes? I wonder.

Well, first because they are pieces of relevant information that may can be of help someday. But they must be easy to recover and to restructure.

Sometimes I see myself writing those post-its and set them on top of my desk trying to put some order, and I smile....

Back to the topic of the post, I read and watched videos about Digital Brain tools, a new brand name for a diary.

I have been using Bullet Journals for the last 3 years, and I had my own way to self organise my tasks previously based on todos and priorities.  I have been writing notebooks, infinite notebooks (I won't do that again), and my lovely remarkable 2.  But at the end, they were only a one-way flow of data.  A dump place where I can throw data and tasks.

But I realised that I was unable to recover data easily.  When I was in need to look for that task I commited to do in a meeting some weeks ago, everything was useless.

I felt the need for speed

So I looked into digital tools to keep record of my activities that were easy to use.  I found this guy and his channel in [Youtube](https://youtube.com), [Emowe](https://www.youtube.com/@emowe) and he was talking exactly about the kind of things I was looking for.

Thanks to his videos, I learnt that I was not alone in my search for a solution to my messy brain, but that there were several tools: Notion, Keep, Obsidian, Logseq...  Wow!!

I watched all his videos and from all the tools he talked about, I selected Logseq.  Why?  Well, that's my next thing to talk about:

**Logseq as a diary**

First thing first.  Logseq entry point is the diary.  And every day you open the tool, you will get a new page with the day on top of it.  It's the kind of things I use to do everyday since I started to write.  So I feel that the authors were soulmates to me.  It uses a bullet and blocks concept that is very flexible and reusable, as every block can be linked, referenced and embedded in any other part of the tool.  Visually is very powerful.

It has an easy template system, easy enough to create a couple of blocks and reuse them into the rest of the diary typing /template and selecting the name of the template block you want to use.  Nice!

Each page in Logseq is a plain text file using Markdown, so it was very similar to the way I'm writing this blog (I'm using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), by the way).  This allows me to use any editor to write notes, and then easily copy-paste into the diary if I was not available to do it at the time (thinking mostly on times I'm in my cellphone).

And last point is that logseq has Windows, Linux, Mac, Android and iOS versions so you can write in every device available. (Later I will talk about synchronization).

By default, the date format is typical English, (Month, day year), but you can change it easily from the Options -> Editor -> Preferred Date Format option.  Setting this to YYYY-MM-DD will make it easier to follow the files in your storage device.

I started to use the blank template for the diary, but then, I realised that I was using the same structure most days, so I created a template and set it up as the default structure for my day.

To do this, I had to open the logseq/config.edn file and modify this section:

```
 ;; Define the default journal page template.
 ;; Enter the template name between the quotes.
 :default-templates
 ;; {:journals ""}
 {:journals "daily"}
```

**Logseq as a search engine**

As you write and link blocks when you need them, Logseq uses a search engine that can be used to query for content you have written before. That's awesome, not only the typical text search, no.  You can use properties, tags, metadata, to look for and retrieve information!  This way you can make a block that can contains information from different blocks, dates, sections...

The query system is a little bit tricky, using [Datalog](https://discuss.logseq.com/t/learning-resources-for-advanced-queries-datalog/8619), but if you are willing to spend your time to understand how it works, it will allow you to do awesome things.

In my case, I have created a page with the sole purpose of keep a list of opened tasks and keep it opened in the right sidebar:

```
#+BEGIN_QUERY
{:title "Open Tasks"
:query [:find (pull ?b [*])
:where
[?b :block/marker "TODO"]]
:collapsed? true}
#+END_QUERY
```

**Logseq as a learning tool**

Features: 
- Using templates, you can create records for books you read, or articles you collect.  
- You can create mindmaps using a simple extension (yes, logseq has extensions too) from any page or block
- You have a whiteboard to draw or organise pieces of information in a visual way
- You can create flashcards easily from your notes using the #card tag in any block

I have created a template for keeping notes from books I have read, for keeping the meetings at work, and for some medical stuff when needed.

I have experimented with the whiteboards to do some diagrams and visualise some topics about emotional management.

Honestly, I haven't progressed too much with the flashcards feature.  I think it can be very powerful for the future, but first I have to make the effort to feed the notes with the kind of information and tags I would like to study later.


**Logseq as your knowledge notebook**

Did I say Logseq supports extensions?  With 2024 LLMs have become a feature on almost every tool I have used so far.  So by installing the [AI Assistant](https://github.com/ahonn/logseq-plugin-ai-assistant) extension, you can connect your diary and your notes with any LLM available and perform several transformations.  Not as powerful as [Google NotebookLM](https://notebooklm.google.com), but can read your texts and answer questions, or help you to resume texts.


**Logseq as your planner / habit tracker**

Logseq support natively tasks, so you can define any block as a task with different states like: TODO, DOING, DONE, CANCELED, NOW, LATER and using another cool command called /schedule you can set tasks to do repetedly or set on a coming day.

There are multiple extensions in this productivity area, but I use it mostly from my phone, so I cannot use extensions and I have restricted myself to use the native interface as much as possible.

In my case, I started using a template for the diary that included a section for annotating tasks and a query in another page for retrieving all tasks still not closed or canceled.  This way I can review easily what was left behind and move some tasks to the present day.

Other experiment I did, was to setup a section for goals that I should check daily / weekly.  Honestly, I have failed totally trying to set this section in an automatic way.  I wasn't capable of close daily all the goals, so they started to pill up on my opened tasks list and I felt upset and finally desisted with the experiment and deleted manually all the created tasks from previous days.

My advice here is to focus on the work you can do, and review what pending task can you bring to your journey, but do not create automatic tasks.

**Logseq and synchronization**

Last thing I want to say about Logseq is that I miss a synchronization with Google Drive. In Android I had to use another tool [Autosync for Google Drive](https://play.google.com/store/search?q=drivesync&c=apps) to keep my phone synced with the rest of devices.

There is a git synchronization feature that was added not far ago, but it's not available (at least not in 0.10.9) in Android.

And if you want to support Logseq, you can become a subscriber to Logseq and use a Sync beta feature instead of using external tools like I did.


**Troubleshooting**

Sometimes, in my setup I have found file conflicts.  When you work from different devices, you can find a synchronization issue that generates two files, one set as the official, and another with the "conflict" suffix.  At least, it's better than find that because the synchronization failed, you have lost several days.

With this my first post of 2025 has ended.  Hopefully I will be able to add more content this year.
