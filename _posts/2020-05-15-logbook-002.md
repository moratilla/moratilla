![Grafana makes dashboards shine](/assets/img/grafana-node-exporter.png){:.lead}
Â¡Input, input!
{:.figure}

This week I have family issues that affected me drastically.  Life has been
 hard this week with health problems.  But I have been pushing.  When the
 elements were in synchrony, I have been able to study more about Grafana and
 Prometheus.  I have been working with PromQL to create some dashboards and
 understanding how to create a exporter for prometheus.

I recommend to read these articles to understand the USE and RED methods for 
 systems and service performance analysis.

* [The USE Method](http://www.brendangregg.com/usemethod.html)
* [The RED Method: A New Approach to Monitoring Microservices](https://thenewstack.io/monitoring-microservices-red-method/)
* [The RED Method: key metrics for microservices architecture](https://www.weave.works/blog/the-red-method-key-metrics-for-microservices-architecture/)
* [RED Method for Prometheus - 3 Key Metrics for Monitoring](https://rancher.com/red-method-for-prometheus-3-key-metrics-for-monitoring/)
* [How we implemented RED and USE metrics for monitoring](https://medium.com/thron-tech/how-we-implemented-red-and-use-metrics-for-monitoring-9a7db29382af)

Also watching webminars about other kubernetes components I have planned to use.

But not too much to comment this week... Not at the techie side.

About hobbies, I haven't played piano too much this week.  Too many visits to
 hospital.  But the last thing I have been doing was really funny: to play a
 rock'n roll rhytm with two hands.  It was difficult for me at the beginning,
 but with just an improvement and little practice, it became very funny.

Let's see if I progress finishing the posts I want to write before end of this
 month.  On Monday I will review my ToDo Board and will evaluate my capacity.
