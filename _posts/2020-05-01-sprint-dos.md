This week has been horrible.  Very low performance because demotivation and low
 energy.  Family issues last weekend carried all this negative energy to me.
  So I'm writing just the good things in order to be more positive and focus on
the good things I have been doing.

## Mood

## Website progress

Things accomplished in the second sprint:

* Create collection for projects
* Sort talks collection by year
* Add a post_deploy step that invalidates Cloudflare's cache

These were included in the previous post, but since then, I have finished these:

* Add ADR's to repository
* Create collection for To do lists
* Investigate about add a testing step in CI with html-proofer

## Comments

Well, the structure of the website is clear and established, so from now on it
 would be easier to add content to the site.

I postponed a story to collect all tags and categories and group them into an
 index page for a next release, when I have more specialized content.

I have decided to focus this week in review the state of the PhaserJS project,
 a framework for game development in JavaScript.  I used it years ago, and it's
 still evolving, so looking something for self-motivation, I have been looking
 to challenge myself to port some speed learning games to HTML5 with the help
 of this framework.

Next week I will be writing monographics about these topics: 

* CircleCI vs Github Actions
* VPN with tinc
* VPN with Zerotier

Let's see how the outbreak keeps progressing...
