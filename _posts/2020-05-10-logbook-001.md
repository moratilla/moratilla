This week has not been as productive as previous, as now the big work has been finished and now I'm working in the details and opening new worm cans.  I have been working on several note taking solutions and services, from google keep to jetbrains youtrack, but I haven't found a perfect solution for me.  I will invest more effort to find my perfect solution for note and task taking.

About the week, I have been learning more about Prometheus and Grafana.  I have used Grafana before, and prometheus it is not so different to my own personal solution for monitoring (based on Sensu, Sysdig, InfluxDB and Grafana), but it seems simpler and less resource consuming.

Other things I have been doing this week are:

* Piano classes

I have got my new piano (bye, bye, old toy), and it's totally amazing.  By the way,
 I'm not kidding when I said the old one was a toy.  Look at the picture:

I have been practicing and my hands now are dying in pain. Oh my god! I didn't know
 wristles could hurt so much!  But I'm satisfied with the new piano, much more 
 comfortable and responsive than any keyboard I have played before..., and elegant.

* Kubernetes Ingress

I have been using ingress-nginx at work before, but now I want to go deeper inside other
 types of ingress controllers in Kubernetes.  I have found a couple of new things
 I didn't know they exist, like [envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/) and [Gloo](https://docs.solo.io/gloo/latest).

 * Blog Posts

I finished the post about tinc-vpn, but it was more complicated than I expected,
 so the rest has been delayed to next week.  Laboratory is almost done, in spanish, but
 done.  So I'm going to delay them to next week.  I'm eager to finish all these posts
 because they are old and a good starting point for the future posts I have planned to write.

Other thing I have been doing is to think how to name this diary I'm keeping
 about the progress with the blog.  I have ended calling it "Logbook", inspired
 by the Clifford Stoll's logbook where he wrote everything about his research about 
 the hunting of the hackers group that is narrated in the book ["The Cuckoo's Egg"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cuckoo's_Egg).  I recommend this book to anyone that is curious about computer security.

* Kids projects

I always wanted to make new games with my kids, so I have been playing with
 them to build a video game, and make a mod for a traditional board game.  You can find them in the projects area.

See you next week.
