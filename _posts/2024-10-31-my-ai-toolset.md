As we step into 2024, I'm excited to share my collection of AI tools that have been useful
 in making my day, at work, and personal tasks more efficient.

I turn on my laptop with ollama started from the login with model llama3.2 3b loaded, which is a great LLM
 for daily interactions. I've been integrating it with anythingLLM to test its
 capabilities on local text sources or web scraping/SQL projects.  Far from perfect, but it's a good start.
 I can create a project in AnythingLLM and upload files and scrape URLs and use them for that project. I expected it to be more featured, like a [NotebookLM from Google](https://notebooklm.google.com/), but not.

I usually work with Visual Studio Code, but Zed.dev AI has become my go-to IDE for general use. It's made on Rust and its memory footprint is incredible small.
One thing I don't like about Visual Studio Code is how rapidly it consumes memory. I know it has lots of extensions and features, sometimes I have found issues with a frozen window that made me lost time and code.
Zed.dev is small, quick and well, not so feature-rich, but it includes a configurable AI assistant and copilot that can be configured to use any public LLM there as well as your own ollama installation. It works
incredibly well with golang, python and javascript and I'm happy with it.

In the past, I used LMStudio before switching to ollama, which was an excellent platform for
testing various LLMs. It has a visual interface very clear and easy to use.  It has a search feature very handy to look for LLMs and features, a chat window for emulating chatgpt and a very powerful set of options about how to load and configure your model.  If you have a dedicated GPU, you can load fully or partially the model into GPU memory, offloading the rest of the hardware for other uses (that's awesome guys!) and the typical options for customize your session.
Finally, it can lunch a server to integrate with other tools and solutions.

I decided to switch to ollama because I wanted to be more focused on productivity and optimization of my workflow.  I'm happy with the decision, but I still use LMStudio for some tasks, especially when I need to test a new model or a new feature.

When it comes to searching for information, Perplexity.ai first and morphic.sh later have been my trusty sidekicks when it comes
to searching for information.

About NotebookLM, I think it's going to be a lifechanger for many people.  It's like an assistant for your large documents or large reading or studying sessions.  You can upload text documents or pdfs and it will help you to summarize, highlight, take notes, flashcards, and even a podcast!

For tasks related to images and photos, I recently stumbled upon two fantastic resources:
* https://piclumen.com/ for free AI image generator and
* https://pixelbin.io/ for personal image transformation tools.

For example, I've been using piclumen to generate the header images for my blog post, and backgrounds for my presentations and smartphone wallpapers.

I'm always on the lookout for new tools and technologies to enhance my workflow, so if you have any
 recommendations, feel free to share them with me. Here's to a productive and innovative 2024! ðŸš€
