title: Logbook - 003 bad week at hospital
categories: [personal]
---

Hi, this week has been very difficult to me as my elder kid is back to hospital
 and we don't know why.  He is having pains and his mood is low energy, very low.
 At hospital doctors where surprised about his condition, as they could not find
 an emerging infection or anything clear to point their fingers to.

With the pandemia, the protocol at hospital is just one parent with the kid all
 the time. No switch allowed.  So my wife is there, and I'm here with the youngest
 one.

My old boy pulse went down (40 ppm) and he was accepted in the Intensive Care Unit.
  For three days now he is there, and his pulse is normal now, but his mood not.

So for this week, I don't want to write anything technical.  Just maybe I'm waiting
 my kid gets fine pretty soon.

Oh, I had a project to do.  Something to have my mind focused on, and distract me
 from other thoughts and feelings.

I am sleeping too bad these days again...
