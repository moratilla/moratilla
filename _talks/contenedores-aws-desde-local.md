Here it is the table of contents:  

    1. Goal
    2. How to access AWS
    3. User Groups in AWS - Oneclick's way
    4. Where ops hides our stuff?
    5. Shared clusters
    6. How AWS ECS Cluster works
    7. Other AWS services we use
    8. DEMO (Through the AWS Management Console)
    9. Using the terminal with AWS CLI
    10. Example: getting RDS endpoints
    11. Example: getting the value of a secret
    12. Example: navigating through project builds
    13. Oneclick oneliners
    14. ECS-CLI
    15. How to config ecs-cli
    16. ECS-CLI: watching running tasks in a cluster

It was an introduction to the elastic architecture that we use to run 
 our applications and how developers can run a build, deploy, and get 
 status and logs.

One hour and a half and I believe I could keep talking more about more things we could do.
