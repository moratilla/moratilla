## Description

The story behind this talk is more interesting than the talk itself, so I'm 
 including it here.

At the begining, the talk was going about what was expected from the DevOps 
 Culture by an auditor point-of-view.  A bank like BBVA has many projects and
 several teams working.  And all the work must be audited to comply with laws
 and other internal compliances.  So, how BBVA is coping with Agile projects?

That was the initial proposal.  Unfortunately the first part of the talk was not
 what we were expecting, but a short introduction about why BBVA needs to hire
 DevOps.  But then we had the opportunity to turn things by asking what I was
 interested on.

By performing several questions (I counted 8 in a raw), I turned a boring talk
 into a very interesting chance to ask auditors about their job in a bank, and
 how was their experience working with agile teams compared against traditional 
 teams and legacy code.

The video was edited just to show the best part of the talk.
