## Description

This time, Ricardo Bartolom√© (@ricbartm) and me talked about Puppet
 Configuration Management, and it's benefits from a sysadmin point of view.  We
 introduced the way we used it in our environments and what features we would 
 like to implement in a future.

Long talk, but I was very satisfied with this one because it was entirely done
 between to busy guys working remotely and sharing our infrastructure tips
 without any restriction.  It was a fantastic experience for that time.
