## Description

A rare opportunity to be back at teaching for the enterprise.  ProductLancers
 contacted me to prepare and to teach a course for some individuals in IBM 
 about DevOps, it's culture and its tools.  Also they would like to know how 
 IBM was using these tools.  The purpose was to introduce these new practices 
 into several teams and promote IBMs teams to use their own tools 
 (IBM Bluemix / Cloud).

### First talk

First time because of time restrictions, I focused on the standard open source
 tools, like:

* git
* Apache maven
* Sonatype nexus
* Sonarqube
* Vagrant
* AWS
* Puppet
* Terraform

And some commercial tools I was in need to show some relevant features like:

* Observability - New Relic
* Communication - Slack
* Log analysis  - Logentries
* 12 Factor Apps deploys - Heroku

### Second talk

The following talk I was asked to use IBM Tools like Bluemix, Pipeline and
 UrbanCode Deploy to adapt the toolchain to proprietary solutions owned by
 IBM.

I learned a lot here, as I was not used to these tools, and it's not common
 for a team to work with commercial apps in our job.

I liked the IBM Bluemix platform and the pipeline CI tool.  Easy to use and very
 portable to other platforms as they were based on the Cloud Foundry foundation.

Also the IBM UrbanCode Deploy tool is a planning tool for deploy code.  You can
 manage systems with agents and create a catalog of applications and resources
 so you can schedule an automatic deployment, and follow all the aspects of the
 deployment process.  Open issues, see reports, check versions deployed...
