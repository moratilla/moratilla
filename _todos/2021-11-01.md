This month I have commited myself to revive my site.  It's hard as I have been
 very busy this year with lots of tasks and experimentation, but now the end of
 the year is near and I'm starting to wrap things up.

New ToDo list format


|Status | Priority | Who  | Task | Time |
| ----: | ---------: | ------------ | ------- | :--------: |
| WIP   | 250 | Friend | Send book through shipping service| |
| WIP   | 200 | Friend | Keep selecting photos for physical album |  |
| WIP   | 100 | Me | Read the Bullet Journal Method | |
| -     | -   | Me | Dental review | |

About my last todo list...

| Priority | Task | Urgency | Outcomes | Costs | Status |
| ---------: | ------------ | :-------: | :--------: | :----: | ------: |
| 110 | Finish piano course | High | High | Low | Done |
| 100 | Finish speedlearner course | Low | High | High | Canceled |
|  90 | Learning Golang | High | High | High | Done |
|  80 | Create proxmox exporter for prometheus | Low | High | High | Canceled |


## Comments

* Proxmox exporter was canceled because I dropped the use of proxmox.
* Speedlearner course was canceled as I couldn't get the time to continue it
