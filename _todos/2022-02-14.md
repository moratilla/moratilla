I have left this todo list as I have been looking into Bullet Journal Method and I'm now testing it.
  There are some reasons:

- I keep doing daily records as usual, but now Time is not a field.
- I have added the Index and the Collections.  Pretty useful.
- I'm not sure about how useful the Future Record will be, but I will give it a try.

So, what I'm going to do with this section?

Good question.

I'm going to note here my commitments for the present month, and then I will review them at the end of each month.
