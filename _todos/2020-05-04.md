## Comments

* Prometheus

I couldn't finish the Prometheus task until Monday as I was busy with kids all
 the weekend.  Also, Prometheus it's easy to deploy, but difficult to understand
 all its PromQL language and I was expend time deploying examples to create
 queries.  I have setup a half dozen of servers with the node_exporter and some
 other examples to catch metrics and visualize them in my Grafana dashboard.
  In general it's pretty simple.  Under the hood is much more easy than my old
 monitoring system, based on Sensu, InfluxDB and Grafana.

* Piano classes

I have got my new piano (bye, bye, old toy), and it's totally amazing.  By the way,
 I'm not kidding when I said the old one was a toy.  Look at the picture:

I have been practicing and my hands now are dying in pain. Oh my god! I didn't know
 wristles could hurt so much!  But I'm satisfied with the new piano, much more 
 comfortable and sensitive than any keyboard I have played before.

* Ingress

I have been using ingress at work, but now I want to go deeper inside other
 types of ingress controllers in Kubernetes.  I have found a couple of new things
 I didn't know they exist, like [envoy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/) and [Gloo](https://docs.solo.io/gloo/latest).

 * Posts

I finished the post about tinc-vpn, but it was more complicated than I expected,
 so the rest has been delayed to next week.  Laboratory is almost done, in spanish, but
 done.
