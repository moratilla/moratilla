## Comments

Do you see?, with this Urgency, Outcomes, Costs prioritization, my own developments and side projects always are left aside.

* I had a project to do in one week so I left all the plan to focus on this project.

* Personal issues: my elder kid is at hospital because he is sick and nobody finds why.  More on the weekly post.
