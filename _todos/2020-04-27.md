## Comments

Too much anxiety to cope with all the things I want to do.  I can't, I can't.

I need to transform tasks in epics, stories, and tasks.  Here I should have a
 prepare session for the week, so I can set the size of stories and split them
 accordingly.

Finally, I'm still struggling around the need of the Urgency, Outcomes, and Costs
 fields.  They are useful to decide which next to take, but I'm not confortable
 with how to set the value.
