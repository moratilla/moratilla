# 3. Choose a theme

Date: 2020-03-02

## Status

Accepted

## Context

After setting a framework, I was looking for a nice theme for a site.  This site is for
 personal use, not for a company.  It should be centered on my profile and works, like a 
 resume.

I want a good theme that can be nice in desktop as well as in mobile (responsive). 2 or 3
 columns because I am not sure how I want to distribute the content.

## Decision

After some time watching themes, I decided to keep using hydejack as my theme.  It was a good decision, as I can do things faster and it makes me feel great.

## Consequences

Installed quickly and without issues.  Adapted to my style very quickly and that made me feel
 happy to see quick progress.

I feel it is the right solution.
