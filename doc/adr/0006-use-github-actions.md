# 6. Use Github Actions

Date: 2024-10-16

## Status

Accepted

## Context

To build and deploy the web I used CircleCI provider, but recently I moved every CI/CD to GitHub Actions. This is a good opportunity to learn more about this new provider.


## Decision

To change the CI/CD provider from CircleCI to GitHub Actions.  Implies creating a new ci file with the same actions than before.

## Consequences

1. Everything will be in the same place.
2. I will learn more about GitHub Actions.
3. I will drop CircleCI.
